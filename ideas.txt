ideas for powerups:
- slow zone for bullets that breach the shield
- bigger shield (duh)
- multi bullet shooting from the core
- complementary shield diametrically opposite from the main shield

Â 

Final product vision:

- Shield that protects core
- Core can shoot bullets
- Enemies that come to attack the core
- Powerups for the shield/core
- Cool visuals + unique enemies
 
- Wave spawning system
- Between waves, upgrades can be bought / Upgrades can be bullets that come, just like hollows
- Cutscene and lore management system
