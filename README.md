# PulseGuard

Run the 'main game.py' file

Requires 'pygame-ce' package installed on the machine in order to run. Install this package using pip

If you have pygame already installed, you might need to uninstall pygame and then pip install pygame-ce. (pygame-ce is backward compatible, so it shouldn't mess up any other pygame projects you may have.. It's just far superior to pygame though, no reason not to migrate to pygame-ce instead :D )


-----------------------
Notes:

I'm still working on the wave spawning mechanics, the difficulty curve feels a bit too steep as of now

Also, will probably add some lore & powerups soon..
